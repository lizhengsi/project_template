    Pressing Ctrl+Shift+B or running Run Build Task from the global Terminal menu
    The task's properties have the following semantic:
    label: The task's label used in the user interface.
    type: The task's type. For a custom task, this can either be shell or process. If shell is specified, the command is interpreted as a shell command (for example: bash, cmd, or PowerShell). If process is specified, the command is interpreted as a process to execute.
    command: The actual command to execute.
    windows: Any Windows specific properties. Will be used instead of the default properties when the command is executed on the Windows operating system.
    group: Defines to which group the task belongs. In the example, it belongs to the test group. Tasks that belong to the test group can be executed by running Run Test Task from the Command Palette.
    presentation: Defines how the task output is handled in the user interface. In this example, the Integrated Terminal showing the output is always revealed and a new terminal is created on every task run.
    options: Override the defaults for cwd (current working directory), env (environment variables), or shell (default shell). Options can be set per task but also globally or per platform. Environment variables configured here can only be referenced from within your task script or process and will not be resolved if they are part of your args, command, or other task attributes.
    runOptions: Defines when and how a task is run.
